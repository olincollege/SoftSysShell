# Building a Unix Shell in C
### Simrun Mutha and Vedaant Kuchhal
## Goals
The goal of our project is to create a shell in C. As our MVP, we want to implement 5 commands which include `ls`, `cd`, `history`, `sleep` and `rm`.  As a stretch goal, we want to add in additional commands like `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv` as well as implement error handling. 

## Learning Goals
**Simrun**: I want to get more comfortable coding in C. I have not worked on a low level project before and donâ€™t know a lot about how a computer runs various processes so I want to gain more familiarity with that as well.

**Vedaant**: I want to take advantage of coding in C to implement programs that would best be done in a low-level language. Creating a shell will be a useful way for me to gain insight into UNIX operating systems while improving my C programming skills.

## Resources
To get started, we have some online resources to follow, including a tutorial. We have already identified a few resources after talking to a CA, such as the fourth chapter of Headfirst C and some online tutorials/ explanations, which are linked below in our first steps. As the project progresses, we will seek out more resources as necessary.

## First Steps
1. Do background reading on how a shell works. Here is one resource we will look at: https://www.cis.rit.edu/class/simg211/unixintro/Shell.html. We will also read Head First Chapter 4 *(Simrun and Vedaant)*.
2. Follow a 3 step tutorial on writing a UNIX shell which is linked here https://indradhanush.github.io/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part. By the end of this tutorial, we should have a basic idea of our approach, with maybe some starter files *(Vedaant)*.
3. Outline overarching code architecture for implementing the various commands. We will have a sketch/flow-chart of sorts by the time we have figured this out. *(Simrun)*
