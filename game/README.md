# Platfrogs
A game where a frog jumps from one lily pad to another.

In Platfrogs, you play as a small frog with big dreams of taking to the sky- so, with the help of some floating lilypads, you take to the skies to see how high you can go. This is a platfromer game, and its goal is to get as high of a score as possible by jumping as many platforms as you can.

## Installation Instructions
